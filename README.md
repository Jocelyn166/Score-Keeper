# Score-Keeper
It's a funny little game that was built with Javascript. The game has two players. You can choose the number you want to play to. The first one who reaches the number will be the winner. Once we have a winner, the buttons are disabled.
If you want another round, you can either click the Reset button or change the playing to number. Open the index.html in your browser, give it a try, and have fun!
