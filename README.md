# Score-Keeper

## Description
It's a funny little game built with Javascript. The game features two players. You can choose the number you want to play to. The first one to reach the number will be declared the winner. Once we have a winner, the buttons are disabled. If you want another round, you can either click the Reset button or change the playing number. Open the `index.html` in your browser, give it a try, and have fun!
